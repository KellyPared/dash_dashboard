## Dash Application Project
This project is a Dash application developed using the Dash framework, which allows you to build interactive web applications with Python.

## Project Structure
The project structure is organized as follows:

* app.py: This is the main file that runs the Dash application server and defines the application layout and callbacks.
* components: This directory contains reusable components or modules that can be used in the application.
* apps: This directory contains separate modules for different pages or sections of the application.
* pages: This directory contains modules defining the layout for different pages or sections of the application.
* data: This directory contains data files or datasets used by the application.

## Datasets
The project utilizes three different datasets:

Kaggle Dataset: This dataset is sourced from Kaggle and provides a comprehensive collection of data for analysis and visualization within the application.

Rural Georgia Dataset: This dataset focuses on rural regions in Georgia, providing specific data points and insights relevant to those areas.

Private School in Florida Dataset: This dataset is specific to private schools in Florida and includes information such as enrollment numbers, academic performance, and other relevant metrics.

## Getting Started
To run the Dash application, follow these steps:

Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
Execute the app.py file using Python: python app.py.
Open your web browser and navigate to the provided URL (usually http://127.0.0.1:8050 or http://localhost:8050).

## Dependencies
The project relies on the following dependencies:

Dash: The core library for building Dash applications.
Dash Bootstrap Components (dbc): A library of Bootstrap-themed Dash components.
Plotly Express (px): A high-level library for interactive data visualization.
Pandas: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library.
pathlib: A module providing classes for working with file and directory paths.
