## Dash Application Project
This project is a Dash application developed using the Dash framework, which allows you to build interactive web applications with Python.

## Project Structure
The project structure is organized as follows:

* app.py: This is the main file that runs the Dash application server and defines the application layout and callbacks.
* components: This directory contains reusable components or modules that can be used in the application.
* apps: This directory contains separate modules for different pages or sections of the application.
* pages: This directory contains modules defining the layout for different pages or sections of the application.
* data: This directory contains data files or datasets used by the application.

## Getting Started
To run the Dash application, follow these steps:

Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
Execute the app.py file using Python: python app.py.
Open your web browser and navigate to the provided URL (usually http://127.0.0.1:8050 or http://localhost:8050).

## Dependencies
The project relies on the following dependencies:

* Dash: The core library for building Dash applications.
* Dash Bootstrap Components (dbc): A library of Bootstrap-themed Dash components.
* Plotly Express (px): A high-level library for interactive data visualization.
* Pandas: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library.
